Hello,

It sounds like you're after support for a Salesforce Application.
The people on this email alias cannot offer any assistance with
the applications built on our API. For help with EventbriteSync,
you'll need to get in touch with our general support team or seek
help from an experience Salesforce Consultant. For other Salesforce
applications, we encourage you to reach out to the application
developer directly.

If you think this is an error, and you are someone who developed your
own application using our API, let me know what requests you're sending
and what you are seeing in the response vs what you are expecting to see.

Thanks,
Eventbrite Developer Support Team
