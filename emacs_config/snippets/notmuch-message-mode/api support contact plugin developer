Hi there,

It sounds like you're using a plugin that uses the Eventbrite API.
Unfortunately, we can't offer any insight into how plugins behave and so
you'll need to reach out to the plugin developer directly for help.

If this is an error and you've built your own application on our API,
please respond with the end points that you're sending requests to, and
what responses you're receiving, vs what you expect.

Any example requests that you can provide would also be helpful.

Best,
Evenbrite Developer Support Team
