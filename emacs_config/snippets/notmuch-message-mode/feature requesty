Hi there,

There is not currently a feature that allows you to ${1:create orders}
with our API. This is an open feature request that we hope
to bring to our API in the future, but I cannot speak to when
it will be implemented and brought to production.

For more information on what you can, and can't (yet!) do with
our API, take a look at the documentation.

Best,
Chris
