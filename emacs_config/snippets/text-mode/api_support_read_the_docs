Hi there,

Thanks for your interest in build on our API.

For specific information about ${1:getting private events},
take a look at this part of the documentation:
${2:https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/endpoints/users/#ebapi-get-users-id-owned-events}

More generally our API is:
    * free and open to the public
    * RESTful - uses a REST style design
    * JSON - returns and accepts JSON data

To find out what all you can and can't (yet!) do with our API,
check out the documentation here:
https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/

If you run into any issues, or something doesn't make sense
after checking the documentation, you can get help by sending
an email to api@eventbrite.com.

Best,
Chris
