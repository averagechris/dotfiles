Hi there,

You are unable to access the /myaccount/apps/ page because your account is a "subuser" - and these kind of accounts are not currently able to create API app keys. Although this will be changing in the coming months, the only way for you to create an app key with access to your organization's data is to have the primary user account login and create the app key.

I hope this helps.

Best,
Chris
