Hi there,

The events search end point is best for retrieving data about
public events, but keep in mind that past events are not
publicly available. Only user account that owns the data can
access past events.

Past events are best accessed on the users owned_events endpoint,
which will return all of a user's events based on the token passed
in during the request.

For example:
GET /users/me/owned_events/
