Hi,

You've contacted the Developer Support team. It seems that this may have
been in error. For general support requests (not regarding API usage)
please contact our support team.

If you are seeking assistance with Eventbrite's API, I apologize for the
confusion. Would you please provide more information on the error or
unexpected behavior you are experiencing while trying to work with the API?

Thanks!
