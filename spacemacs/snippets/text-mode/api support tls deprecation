Hi there,

You're seeing this issue because your application is sending requests using an outdated version of TLS. We no longer support TLS versions 1.1 or 1.0. We've sent proactive communication about this deprecation to the email address related to app keys about this for the past 6 months.

For more information about TLS and TLS deprecation, take a look at the article that our Help Center Team wrote:

I hope this helps.

Best,
Chris
