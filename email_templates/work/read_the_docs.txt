Hi there,

Thanks for your interest in build on our API. Our API is:
    * free and open to the public
    * RESTful - uses a REST style design
    * JSON - returns and accepts JSON data

Check out <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/">the documentation</a>
to find out what all you can and can't (yet!) do with our API. If you run into any
issues, or something doesn't make sense after checking the documentation, you can
reach out for help by sending an email to api@eventbrite.com.

Best,
Chris
