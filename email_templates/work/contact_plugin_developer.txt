Hi there,

You've contacted the developer support team. It sounds like you need help with
an application or plugin that integrates with our API. Unfortunately, we have
no way to help you, so you'll need to reach out to the plugin or application
developer.

If this is an error, and you've built your own application on our API, let us
know which end points you're sending requests to, and what responses you see
vs. what you expect to see.

Best,
Eventbrite Developer Support
